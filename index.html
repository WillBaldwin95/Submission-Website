                    <p class="CARP-text caption">I wanted to incorporate the "T" and "F" of the True/ False Festival in a geometric and overlapping style. Also, by structuring the two letters as I have and including the logo opposite them I'm trying to follow the rule of thirds.</p>

                    <p class="CARP-text caption">In this poster I wanted to continue the shape of the logo to the whole poster by elongating the axis present in the the logo to the whole page but also contrast the logo by swapping the colours present in the logo.</p>

                    <p class="CARP-text caption">This poster uses repetition of the letters in the logo but enlarged to fill their repective segments of the page. I also continues the same colours for both the background and the letters themselves.</p>

                    <p class="CARP-text caption">For my final choice I used my initial poster design but with some adjustments. Elongating the second half of the "F" to make the intention clearer. Also tiding up the text and adjustiung the font.</p>

                    <p class="type-text caption">The Axial System. To avoid this example looking like a restaraunt menu, I have limited myself to only one piece of text being centred on the page and the rest being aligned to the central axis.</p>

                    <p class="type-text caption">The Radial System. This system relies on all your text originating from or converging on a single point. Usually from the centre of a circle both on and off screen.</p>

                    <p class="type-text caption">The Dilatational System. I enjoyed using this system to create an interesting effect. Arching text shrinking in scale can be used to demonstrate priority.</p>

                    <p class="type-text caption">The Random System. The biggest thought in my head making this was simply; "Is it still legible?" If the answer was a clear yes then it easn't random enough. I think I got it where I wanted it.</p>

                    <p class="type-text caption">The Grid System. This one felt tricky to do, the advice I found seemed to be along the lines of, make a grid without making a grid which seemed maddingly unhelpful but I feel I achieved what the system is aiming for.</p>

                    <p class="type-text caption">The Transitional System. I like this system even if it is difficult to find examples of. I like the way that everything flows together to create a uniform piece of text.</p>

                    <p class="type-text caption">The Bilateral System. At risk of sounding like a plagiarist I find this system quite dull, it feels like a cross between the grid system and the axial system and I don't much like either of those, I can see it's uses though.</p>

                    <p class="type-text caption">The Modular System. This system is really fun to use and had I some more skills with the programs involved I think I would have had a more interesting piece to show of this system.</p>

                <li>This website has been primarily designed to be accessable to one person, the person responsible for marking my final submission. With more effort and practice I probably will use this website as a way of demonstrating my ability to code an accessable website. In that case the target audience will likely expand to include protential employers, friends and generally anyone who I think might be impressed by my work.</li>
                <li>This website currently includes examples of CARP principles in the form of posters, an example of each of the different typography systems, links to websites created and adjusted through the worksheets provided in my lectures and finally this user experience piece. Below this are included some of my physical attempts to plan out this website. I have attempted to add some detail to the footer of the webpage so the page has a defined end point and doesn't simply trail off.</li>
